- **Inconsistent Standards:** Each team uses different patterns, tools, versions
- **Hidden Technical Debt:** No visibility into accumulating issues until critical
- **Deployment Chaos:** Lost track of what's deployed where
- **Reporting Overhead:** Board wants metrics, but data is scattered

### 💭 Quotes
