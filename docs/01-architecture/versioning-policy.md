# 🛡️ Organization Versioning Policy

**Status**: Active
**Enforced by**: `.releaserc.json` & GitHub Actions

## The Golden Rule 🌟

> **🚫 DO NOT MANUALLY EDIT THE VERSION IN `package.json`**

We use **Semantic Release** to automate version management. The version number in `package.json` is effectively a placeholder. The "Single Source of Truth" for versions are **Git Tags**.

## How it works

1.  **You Commit**: Use Conventional Commits (`feat: ...`, `fix: ...`).
2.  **You Push/Merge**: Code lands in `main`.
3.  **Bot Acts**: The `release.yml` workflow runs.
    -   It analyzes your commits.
    -   It calculates the next version (e.g., `1.8.4` -> `1.8.5`).
    -   It updates `package.json`.
    -   It creates a Git Tag (`v1.8.5`).
    -   It creates a GitHub Release.
    -   It pushes changes back to `main`.

## Avoiding Conflicts

If you edit `package.json` version manually locally (e.g., `0.11.3`), you will inevitably conflict with the Bot's version (e.g., `1.8.4`) when you try to merge.

**Correct Workflow:**

1.  **Always Pull First**:
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    git checkout -b my-feature
    ```
2.  **Never Touch Version**: Ignore the version field in `package.json`. Let the bot handle it.

## Troubleshooting

If you have a version conflict (`package.json`):
1.  **Reset** your local version change.
2.  **Accept Incoming**: Take the version from `origin/main`.
3.  **Continue**: Your PR is about code, not versions.
